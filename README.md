## 📜 Trademark Description (as filed)

> “Software as a service featuring systems for signal governance via constitutional compression and recursion protocols; includes gates enforcing compression and resonance thresholds before downstream execution, without reliance on AI models; diagnostic controls classify and respond to signal/noise across tokens, words, and messages; generates lineage-bound digital artifacts cryptographically linked to origin cycles, ensuring replication resistance and integrity; civic interfaces display compression proofs and integrity metrics for audit, verification, and digital licensing; platform as a service for signal authentication, noise collapse, and digital asset generation; built for scalable offline operation without cloud or model dependency; includes diagnostic layers for synchronization, cadence mapping, and reflex-triggered behaviors; enables resonance analysis, session fidelity scoring, and origin verification; enforces compression governance via behavioral rhythm over model inference.”
